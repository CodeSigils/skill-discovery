## 1. The Landscape (live-verified 2026-07-01)

### 1.1 Hermes Built-in Hub (local cache)

The Hermes agent ships with a pre-populated hub index. No network calls needed.

| Field | Value | Source |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Index format | JSON (`version`, `generated_at`, `skill_count`, `skills`) | `~/.hermes/skills/.hub/index-cache/hermes-index.json` |
| Index age | 2026-05-26 — **stale (~5 weeks)** | `generated_at` field |
| Total indexed | 2,460 skills | Live cache count |

**Source breakdown of the 2,460 indexed skills:**

| Source | Skills | Trust | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| skills.sh | 1,218 | Community | Primary public leaderboard. Powers featured cache. Install via `npx skills add` |
| lobehub | 500 | Community | LobeChat skill catalog |
| browse-sh | 330 | Community | Browser-level skill collection |
| clawhub | 200 | Evaluate | OpenClaw marketplace — treat as untrusted until inspected |
| github | 127 | High | Community repos, transparent |
| official | 84 | Highest | Hermes-bundled, maintained |
| claude-marketplace | 1 | High | Single entry |
| **Total** | **2,460** | | |

**Metadata fields per skill (all sources):** `name`, `description`, `identifier`, `source`, `repo`, `path`, `tags`, `extra`, `trust_level`. The `skills.sh` source also includes `resolved_github_id`.

**Available metadata across sources:**

```text
All sources:  name, description, identifier, source, repo, path, tags, extra, trust_level
skills.sh:    + resolved_github_id
```

**Featured skills cache:** 100 curated skills from major vendors (Anthropic, Microsoft Azure, Vercel, Remotion) at
`skills_sh_featured.json`. All sourced from skills.sh.

**Key constraint: The hub catalog is an INDEX, not an INSTALL.** Most skills exist only in the index — they are not
downloaded locally. A hub search finds entries, but `skill_view(name)` only works for physically installed skills.

### 1.2 External Marketplaces (live scan 2026-07-01)

All URLs verified with `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`.

| Marketplace | URL | Status | Role | Coverage signal |
| ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| skills.sh | https://skills.sh/ | 200 | Primary public leaderboard | 1,218 skills in hub index. All-time leaderboard, per-skill pages. |
| agentskill.sh | https://agentskill.sh/ | 200 | Broad marketplace; role/platform filtering, quality + security scores | Large cross-platform catalog |
| SkillsMP | https://skillsmp.com/ | 200 | Broad SKILL.md aggregator; occupation/category map | 270K+ SKILL.md files claimed |
| ClawHub | https://clawhub.ai/ | 200 | OpenClaw skills and plugins marketplace | 200 skills in hub index |
| skilldock.io | https://skilldock.io/ | 200 | Registry of agent skills; versioned, publish/install | 1st gen: 10+ repos, 20+ skills. V2 in development. |
| agentskills.io | https://agentskills.io/ | 200 | Open specification standard | 21.3K★ repo. **Client Showcase page is now 404** (as of 2026-07-01) |

---

### 1.3 agentskills.io Client Ecosystem

Live count from the home page carousel (deduplicated): **42 clients**.

| Client | Type | URL |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| Claude Code | IDE agent | claude.ai/code |
| OpenAI Codex | CLI agent | developers.openai.com/codex |
| Gemini CLI | CLI agent | geminicli.com |
| GitHub Copilot | IDE plugin | github.com |
| Cursor | IDE | cursor.com |
| VS Code | IDE | code.visualstudio.com |
| Junie | IDE agent | junie.jetbrains.com |
| OpenCode | CLI agent | opencode.ai |
| Roo Code | CLI agent | roocode.com |
| TRAE | IDE agent | trae.ai |
| Goose | CLI agent | block.github.io/goose |
| OpenHands | CLI agent | openhands.dev |
| Claude | Web agent | claude.ai |
| Spring AI | Framework | docs.spring.io/spring-ai |
| Snowflake Cortex Code | Data platform | docs.snowflake.com |
| Google AI Edge Gallery | Edge AI | github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery |
| Fast Agent | Framework | fast-agent.ai |
| Letta | Memory framework | letta.com |
| Mistral AI Vibe | CLI agent | github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe |
| Laravel Boost | Framework | github.com/laravel/boost |
| Tabnine | IDE plugin | tabnine.com |
| Factory | AI worker | factory.ai |
| Workshop | Platform | workshop.ai |
| Qodo | Testing | qodo.ai |
| VS Code Extensions (VT Code, Amp, bub, etc.) | IDE extensions | — |
| **... and 18 more** | | |

**Notable:** Hermes Agent is NOT listed. Hermes is an agentskills.io client (it loads skills from `skills/*/SKILL.md`),
but is not (yet) registered on the showcase.

## 2. How HQ Implements Discovery (hub-explorer skill)

The HQ repo ships a complete discovery methodology. Key components:

### 2.1 The Search Pipeline

```
INDEX.md miss
  → Hub catalog (hermes-index.json) — keyword, tag, source filter
  → Featured cache (skills_sh_featured.json)
  → External marketplaces (13 sources in references/sources.md)
  → Hermes Atlas ecosystem directory
  → Upstream GitHub search
  → Build from scratch
```

### 2.2 Search Methods

| Method | Tool | What it does |
| -------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Keyword search | Python script | Searches `name` + `description` in hermes-index.json |
| Tag discovery | Python script | Filters by `tags` field |
| Source filtering | Python script | Filters by source repo (e.g. `anthropics`, `microsoft`) |
| Featured search | Python script | Queries skills_sh_featured.json |
| External table | references/sources.md | 13 sources with trust posture, search path, use cases |

### 2.3 Evaluation Checklist

From hub-explorer SKILL.md:
- Check name (descriptive?)
- Read description (matches task?)
- Check source (official > github > others)
- Verify installed status
- If not installed: extract guidance, execute directly, offer to build
- Consider alternatives in same domain
- Check Hermes compatibility

### 2.4 Strengths of the HQ Approach

- **No network calls.** All hub data is local cache.
- **Structured fallback.** INDEX → hub → featured → external → build.
- **Trust tiers.** `official` > `github` > others. Declared in source matrix.
- **Portable methodology.** 95% of the discovery workflow is agent-agnostic.
- **Evaluation rubric.** Systematic before proposing to user.
- **Publishing pipeline.** `hermes skills publish`, `external_dirs`, Atlas registration.

### 2.5 Weaknesses of the HQ Approach

| Issue | Impact | Root cause |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Hub index stale (2026-05-26) | New skills invisible | Cache not auto-refreshed |
| No freshness tracking | Can't know how stale a find is | No `last_verified` on results |
| External sources table has 13 rows | Hard to maintain, risks drift | Hand-maintained prose |
| agentskills.io Client Showcase is 404 | Can't verify client count | Platform URL drift |
| Index has 7 sources but 3 dominate | skills.sh (50%) + lobehub (20%) + browse-sh (13%) = 83% | Uneven source import |
| No registry-level comparison | No structured per-source comparison | No ecosystem comparison framework applied to marketplaces |

**Cumulative:** The HQ discovery methodology is structurally sound (search → evaluate → fallback → recommend), but the
data it depends on (hub index, external sources table) is hand-maintained and drifts. The bridge repo's opportunity is
not to replicate the methodology — it's to ship a **self-verifying discovery skill** that checks source freshness as
part of the search pipeline.

---

## 3. Discovery Layers — What Happens at Each Level

The landscape reveals three distinct layers. They're often conflated.

### Layer A: Agent-Side Retrieval (what the runtime provides)

The CLI, config, or API that loads skills into a session. This is platform-specific:

| Platform | Retrieval mechanism |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Hermes | `hermes skills search`, `skill_view()`, `skills.external_dirs`, hub cache |
| Claude Code | Directory walk `.claude/skills/`, plugin.json, skillOverrides config |
| Codex CLI | Directory walk `.codex/skills/`, `$skill-installer` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini skills list`, `gemini skills install`, directory walk |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/` — no search, just glob match |

**Bridge insight:** The bridge repo should NOT ship a retrieval mechanism for every
platform. The runtime provides those. What it should ship is a **discovery methodology**
that any agent can follow to find skills, regardless of platform.

### Layer B: Catalog Research (what the agent does to find skills)

The systematic search across index → marketplaces → GitHub. This is the HQ
hub-explorer pattern, and it's where the bridge repo has the most portable value.

**Three sub-methods:**
- **Catalog search** — keyword + tag + source filter against the hub index
- **Marketplace scan** — fallback chain through known marketplaces
- **GitHub deep search** — direct repo inspection when catalogs miss

### Layer C: Publishing / Registration (how skills become discoverable)

Getting a skill into the findable pool:
- `hermes skills publish` (Hermes-specific)
- `external_dirs` config entry (Hermes-specific)
- skills.sh auto-indexing (auto from GitHub activity)
- agentskill.sh submission (manual)
- Hermes Atlas registration (GitHub issue)
- Claude Code plugin.json (platform-specific)

**Bridge insight:** The bridge repo should register itself on discoverable channels
(Atlas, skills.sh auto-index), but should NOT ship publish scripts — each runtime
provides its own.

---

## 4. The Real Opportunity: A Discovery Methodology Skill

The bridge repo should not be a static skill collection. It should be a **discovery
methodology skill** — a portable SKILL.md any agent can load that teaches it how to
scan the ecosystem and find the right skill for a task.

### 4.1 What the Discovery Skill Would Contain

1. **Fallback chain** (INDEX → hub → featured → marketplaces → GitHub → build)
2. **Keyword generation** — how to map a task description to 2-3 search keywords
3. **Search methods** — Python scripts for hub keyword/tag/source search
4. **Evaluation rubric** — name, description, source trust, installed status, alternatives
5. **Freshness check** — verify index age, note staleness in results
6. **Project-portfolio mapping** — map candidates to active projects, tier by impact
7. **Skill creation fallback** — how to build a minimal skill when nothing matches

### 4.2 What Gets Removed vs Kept

| From the original bridge plan | Verdict | Rationale |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| 3 static skills | **Drop.** Replace with 1 discovery methodology skill | A static collection doesn't discover anything |
| ci-check.py | **Drop.** | Discovery methodology has nothing to CI-check |
| .github/workflows/ | **Drop.** | No generated artifacts to validate |
| shell-scripting skill | **Keep only if discovery finds it** | Let the methodology find it, don't ship it |
| agent-best-practices skill | **Keep only if discovery finds it** | Same |
| skill-discovery-workflow | **This IS the methodology** | Rename and focus on the discovery pipeline |

### 4.3 Target Structure (revised)

```
skill-discovery/
├── README.md              # "This is a discovery methodology for finding skills"
├── docs/
│   └── 2026-07-01-hub-marketplace-research.md  # Evidence base (this file)
├── skills/
│   └── skill-discovery/   # The core product: portable discovery methodology
│       └── SKILL.md       # Fallback chain, search methods, evaluation rubric
└── .github/
    ├── workflows/ci.yml   # checkout → Hermes-refs check
    └── scripts/ci-check.py # single grep call
```

### 4.4 What The Bridge Should NOT Do

- **Not a skill collection.** Static collections are what addyosmani already does.
- **Not a GitHub search tool.** The user's agent already has search capabilities.
- **Not a Hermes-specific hub explorer.** HQ already ships that.
- **Not an index or catalog.** The hub index does that. The bridge teaches agents to *use* it.
- **Not a publish pipeline.** Each runtime provides its own.
- **Not a comparison framework.** The ecosystem-comparison-framework reference in HQ already covers that.

**The bridge is a methodology, not a repository.**

## 6. Open Questions

| # | Question | Evidence state | Suggested research path |
| --- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | How often does the Hermes hub index auto-refresh? | Index is dated 2026-05-26. Not known if this is pull-based or push-based. | `rg -r 'hub.*refresh\|index.*update\|sync' ~/.hermes/config.yaml ~/.hermes/plugins/ --include='*.py' 2>/dev/null \| head` |
| 2 | Is there a CLI command to force-refresh the hub index? | Not in `hermes skills list` or `hermes skills search` docs seen so far. | `hermes help` / `hermes skills --help` / check `hermes_cli/skills_hub.py` in the Hermes source |
| 3 | Which agentskills.io clients support SKILL.md with optional features (scripts, references)? | Spec says optional, but per-platform support unknown. | Test on each target platform or check per-platform docs |
| 4 | What are the actual root-level skill repo patterns for top-20 Atlas repos? | Only 7 repos measured so far (research note). 20 would give statistical confidence. | `for r in ...; do curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$r/git/trees/main?recursive=1" \| python3 -c "..." ; done` |

## 7. Key Findings

### 7.1 Confirmed from Live Data

- **2,460 skills indexed** in the Hermes hub from 7 sources — the hub is useful but exists alongside the bridge, not inside it.
- **42 agentskills.io clients** — the standard is broadly adopted. The bridge should follow it.
- **agentskills.io Client Showcase page is broken** (404) — external dependency risk.
- **Hub index is 5 weeks stale** — discovery results may miss new skills.
- **skills.sh dominates the index** (50% of entries) — single source risk.
- **Hermes is NOT on the agentskills.io client showcase** — the bridge repo could mention this.

### 7.2 Root Causes of the Drift (why the bridge plan went off-track)

The original bridge plan treated the project as a **portable skill collection** — take 3
skills from HQ, strip Hermes refs, ship them cleanly. Three things were wrong:

1. **The product was never a collection.** It was a discovery system. A static set of
   skills contradicts the core purpose — "scan best resources and discover best skills."
2. **Optimizing for file count masked the product question.** Getting from 161 files to
   11 is a nice constraint exercise, but it doesn't answer "what does this repo do when
   invoked?"
3. **The HQ hub-explorer skill already has the methodology.** The bridge doesn't need
   to build a new discovery system — it needs to extract the **portable methodology**
   from hub-explorer's Hermes-specific shell, so any agent on any platform can follow it.

### 7.3 Corrected Direction

> The bridge repo ships a **portable discovery methodology skill** that teaches any agent
> how to scan the ecosystem — hub catalog, featured cache, external marketplaces, GitHub
> — evaluate candidates, and recommend the best skill for a task. It does NOT ship skills.

This changes:

| Question | Old answer (bridge plan) | New answer (research-informed) |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| What does this repo do? | Ships 3 clean portable skills | Ships a discovery methodology any agent can follow |
| How does it find skills? | From the repo's `skills/` directory | From the ecosystem — hub, marketplaces, GitHub |
| What's the core artifact? | A collection of SKILL.md files | A single SKILL.md teaching the search/evaluate/recommend workflow |
| How does it stay fresh? | CI checks file counts | The methodology always starts with a staleness check on the hub index |
