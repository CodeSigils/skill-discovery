# skill-bridge-hq

**A portable discovery methodology for agent skills.** This repo teaches
any agentskills.io-compatible agent how to find the best skill for a task
-- scanning catalogs, marketplaces, and GitHub; evaluating candidates; and
recommending the best match.

> This is a **methodology**, not a skill collection. It teaches agents
> how to find skills. The hub already has 2,460 indexed skills -- a static
> collection adds nothing next to that.

## Quick Start

Clone this repo and tell your agent to load `skill-discovery`:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/CodeSigils/skill-bridge-hq
```

Then make the skill discoverable. Choose your platform:

<details>
<summary><b>Hermes Agent</b></summary>

**Recommended:** Add the repo path to `skills.external_dirs` in
`~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - /path/to/skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery
```

This makes skill changes visible without reinstalling and survives
Hermes upgrades.

**Alternative:** Copy the skill directly:

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery ~/.hermes/skills/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (Anthropic)</b></summary>

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .claude/skills/
```

Claude Code discovers skills by scanning `.claude/skills/` for
`SKILL.md` files.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex CLI (OpenAI)</b></summary>

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .codex/skills/
```

Codex CLI discovers skills in `.codex/skills/` via filesystem walk.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode CLI</b></summary>

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .opencode/skills/
```

Or create a symlink (zero-maintenance pointer):

```bash
ln -s /path/to/skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .opencode/skills/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Cursor uses `.cursor/rules/` for skill-like content:

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .cursor/rules/
```

Note: Cursor applies rules as chat context, not via
invocation-based discovery like CLI-focused agents.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

Copilot uses a plugin marketplace model rather than filesystem-based
skill discovery. For platform-native skills, search the
[awesome-copilot](https://github.com/topics/awesome-copilot) ecosystem.

The methodology's content can be adapted as a Copilot extension,
but direct SKILL.md loading is not natively supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI (Google)</b></summary>

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery .agents/skills/
```

Gemini CLI explicitly supports `.agents/skills/` as a cross-tool path.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Generic agentskills.io client</b></summary>

Copy the skill to your agent's configured skills directory. Most
clients that support the agentskills.io standard scan a `skills/`
or `.agents/skills/` directory.

```bash
cp -r skill-bridge-hq/skills/skill-discovery <your-skills-dir>/
```
</details>

The repo also ships a `skill-discovery` symlink under `.agents/skills/`
for clients that auto-scan that path. If your agent reads
`.agents/skills/`, discovery is automatic after clone.

**7 files.** One skill. One CI check. Zero platform adapter files.

## What This Repo Does NOT Include

| Excluded | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Static skill collection | The hub already has 2,460 indexed skills — a collection adds nothing next to that number. |
| Install scripts | Every platform provides native skill consumption paths. A script would compete and drift. |
| Platform adapter files (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/` etc.) | User-side setup only. The repo ships only `skills/*/SKILL.md` and a single cross-tool symlink. |
| index.json or plugin.json | No marketplace distribution. Filesystem discovery is sufficient at 1 skill. |
| Hermes-specific references | Any `skill_view()` or `hermes` CLI reference would silently break on non-Hermes agents. CI catches this. |
| Development artifacts (ADRs, review pipeline, architecture docs) | These stay in the source repo. The bridge ships only the shipping surface. |

## What the Methodology Teaches

When invoked, `skill-discovery` guides any agent through:

1. **Freshness check** -- verify the catalog is up to date before searching
2. **Keyword search** -- match tasks to skills by name, description, and tags
3. **Source filtering** -- prefer official over community sources
4. **Featured/curated source search** -- when keyword search is thin
5. **External marketplace scan** -- fallback through marketplaces and GitHub
6. **Evaluation rubric** -- systematically assess each candidate
7. **Skill creation fallback** -- build a minimal skill when nothing matches

The methodology is self-verifying -- it teaches agents to check
source reachability at runtime rather than relying on hardcoded
URLs that drift.

## Evidence Base

This methodology was informed by live research on 2026-07-01:

- **2,460 skills** indexed in the Hermes hub from 7 sources
- **42 clients** confirmed on agentskills.io (home page carousel)
- **6 external marketplaces** verified reachable
- **agentskills.io Client Showcase: returned 404 at ~02:00 UTC, 200 by ~06:24 UTC same day** -- drift confirmed within hours
- **Hub index: 5 weeks stale** -- freshness check essential
